## Week1

### [P1-Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

- [Solution](https://github.com/rahulyad011/leetcode-practice/blob/main/python_solutions/two_sum.py)

### [P20-Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)
Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

- [Solution](https://github.com/rahulyad011/leetcode-practice/blob/main/python_solutions/valid_parentheses.py)

### [P21-Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)
Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

- [Solution](https://github.com/rahulyad011/leetcode-practice/blob/main/python_solutions/merge-two-sorted-lists.py)

### [P121-Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day. You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

- [Solution](https://github.com/rahulyad011/leetcode-practice/blob/main/python_solutions/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock.py)

### [P125-Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome)
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day. You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

- [Solution](https://github.com/rahulyad011/leetcode-practice/blob/main/python_solutions/valid-palindrome.py)

### [P226-Invert Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/)
Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.

- [Solution](https://github.com/rahulyad011/leetcode-practice/blob/main/python_solutions/invert-binary-tree.py)

### [P242-Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/)
Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise. An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

- [Solution](https://github.com/rahulyad011/leetcode-practice/blob/main/python_solutions/valid-anagram.py)

### [P704-Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search)
Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

- [Solution](https://github.com/rahulyad011/leetcode-practice/blob/main/python_solutions/binary-search.py)

### [P733-Flood Fill](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/)
To perform a flood fill, consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels (also with the same color), and so on. Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels with color.

Return the modified image after performing the flood fill.

- [Solution](https://github.com/rahulyad011/leetcode-practice/blob/main/python_solutions/flood-fill.py)

### [P235-Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome)
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

- [Solution](https://github.com/rahulyad011/leetcode-practice/blob/main/python_solutions/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree.py)

### [P110-Balanced Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree/)
Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

- [Solution](https://github.com/rahulyad011/leetcode-practice/blob/main/python_solutions/balanced-binary-tree.py)

### [P141-Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)
Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

- [Solution](https://github.com/rahulyad011/leetcode-practice/blob/main/python_solutions/linked-list-cycle.py)

### [P232-Implement Queue using Stacks](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/)
Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

- [Solution](https://github.com/rahulyad011/leetcode-practice/blob/main/python_solutions/implement-queue-using-stacks.py)
